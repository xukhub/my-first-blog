She's sitting right here next to me. Let's hear how she's feeling.</p>
<p>"how are you feeling right now, huy?"</p>
<strong>"sleepy.."</strong>
<p>"how do you feel about your success?"</p>
<strong>"nothing"</strong>

<strong>"I'm very happy I learned something here,
    all my thanks must go to you for bringing me here,
    and introducing me to django girls, I guess they deserve a bit of my

    wonderful and lovely you! Thank you from all my heart!"</strong>
